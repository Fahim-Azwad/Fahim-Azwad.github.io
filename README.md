I'm a Computer Science graduate who worked with [Prof. Mahbubul Alam Majumdar](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/about/people/mahbubul-alam-majumdar-phd), [Prof. Md Sadek Ferdous](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=DnQAee0AAAAJ&hl=en), and [Prof. Md. Golam Rabiul Alam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t4GrJR4AAAAJ&hl=en) at BRAC University. Recently, I served as a Data Integration Manager and  Web Developer at [FazTrack LLC, Arizona](https://faztrack.com/), where I oversaw the website transition for [Treehouse Communities](https://rootsmg.com/), managing 700+ RV homes across 114 US properties until it was acquired by Roots Management Group.

As data, AI, and blockchain reshape our world, there's a critical need to make these technologies accessible, especially in Southeast Asia's social and medical sectors. The challenge lies in the technical expertise these innovations demand. My mission is to bridge this gap by creating user-friendly interfaces that democratize these powerful technologies, making them accessible to everyone â€“ not just programmers and domain experts.

Beyond my technical pursuits, I love reading (currently on a 40 books per year pace), working out (maintaining 12% body fat), and producing ["NotFixedYet Podcast"](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7qJdT0yI-Y/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) - where I explore entrepreneurship and technology that shape our future.

## Ongoing Projects

### Applications of Diffusion AI Models in the Medical Field and its Data Analysis
Diffusion models are generative AI algorithms that create new data (i.e., images and videos) by systematically removing noise from random datasets. In healthcare, while they are showing promising applications, each medical use case requires careful adaptation. The field is rapidly evolving, with new research findings published daily, making it challenging for practitioners to stay updated and implement these advances effectively. In an ideal scenario, all the research would be consolidated in a single place based on their holistic context.

To alleviate this issue, we are conducting research to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of diffusion models in the medical field. This methodical study uses data analysis and survey best practices to identify existing research. We also analyze characteristics based on the data provided and explore the premise of the research, including the country-context in which the research was conducted and developed. We would further like to explore how these can be used in mental health field.
