I'm a Computer Science graduate who worked with [Prof. Mahbubul Alam Majumdar](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/about/people/mahbubul-alam-majumdar-phd), [Prof. Md Sadek Ferdous](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=DnQAee0AAAAJ&hl=en), and [Prof. Md. Golam Rabiul Alam](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t4GrJR4AAAAJ&hl=en) at BRAC University. Recently, I served as a Data Integration Manager and  Web Developer at [FazTrack LLC, Arizona](https://faztrack.com/), where I oversaw the website transition for [Treehouse Communities](https://rootsmg.com/), managing 700+ RV homes across 114 US properties until it was acquired by Roots Management Group.

With data, AI and blockchain technologies changing the lives of millions around the globe, there is a growing need to make these innovations accessible, particularly in social and medical contexts across Southeast Asia. But one needs to be apt at programming and have knowledge about that specific domain, making it harder for people to comprehend these life altering tech. To bridge this gap, my current research and work focus on democratizing these technologies by creating user-friendly interfaces that enable everyday people to harness the power of data, AI, and blockchain without extensive technical expertise.

Beyond my technical pursuits, I love reading (currently on a 40 books per year pace), working out (maintaining 12% body fat), and producing ["NotFixedYet Podcast"](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7qJdT0yI-Y/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) - where I explore entrepreneurship and technology that shape our future.

## On-Going Projects

### Applications of AI Diffusion AI Models in the Medical Field and its Data Analysis
Diffusion models are generative AI algorithms that create new data (i.e., images and videos) by systematically removing noise from random datasets. In healthcare, while they are showing promising applications, each medical use case requires careful adaptation. The field is rapidly evolving, with new research findings published daily, making it challenging for practitioners to stay updated and implement these advances effectively. In an ideal scenario, all the research would be consolidated in a single place based on their holistic context.

To alleviate this issue, we are conducting research to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of diffusion models in the medical field. This methodical study uses data analysis and survey best practices to identify existing research. We also analyze characteristics based on the data provided and explore the premise of the research, including the country-context in which the research was conducted and developed. We would further like to explore how these can be used in mental health field.
